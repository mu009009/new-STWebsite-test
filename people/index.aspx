           <h3>We're obsessed with muscling more sales out of massive databases, building widgets and dashboards that deliver real-time sales volume and tackling other assorted sales driving marketing programs.</h3>

<p>  And at Technekes, we all share a passion for creating demand for our client’s business. We pride ourselves on helping our employees grow and thrive in the work place. It's not very often you'll find former farmers, bankers, pharmaceutical reps, and EMTs under a single roof the way you do at Technekes. </p>   
<p>But it's even more rare to find a collection of people who are so single-minded and passionate about what we do. Who enjoy the work and working together with our partners and clients. </p>

                  <hr>
                  <p>Scott's been with Technekes practically from the beginning, initially as a one-man creative department, but quickly earning a reputation as the office "go-to, get-er-done guy," embodying the Technekes work ethic.</p>
                  <p>In other words, Scott hasn't met a challenge here that he hasn't embraced, devoting as much energy to developing and refining the process as to delivering extraordinary results. Toward that goal, in recent years, he's taken on a new role: Leading two teams - our growing creative team and our newly-created user experience team - to deliver client solutions that are both well-crafted and well-executed.</p>
                  <p>As Scott notes, "A great idea can't stand alone. To get results, it must be well-executed. Likewise, a perfectly-executed campaign can't deliver results unless it is also well-conceived."</p>
                  <p>To keep his two teams on the same page, Scott spends most mornings in "Scrum" — a daily standup meeting to ensure all team members are on the same page. On weekends, however, you're far more likely to find him hiking in the North Carolina mountains with his wife and toddler.</p>

                  <p>Steve is a leader. He's an organizer and a builder of teams, passionate about results ever since his days as a college soccer player.</p>
                  <p>Steve's professional career began, oddly enough, when he was hired fresh out of college by Preston to work at a direct marketing agency in Charlotte. From the very beginning of his entrepreneurial career, Steve focused on enterprise software and technology transformation projects, working with an impressive list of Fortune 100 companies and growing several start-ups in the process. Now, that ability to tackle big-company challenges with an entrepreneurial perspective is what makes Steve so valuable &mdash; both to our company and our clients.</p>

                  <p>Under Steve's leadership, Technekes has flourished, growing in ways both measurable and not. We're now three times the size we once were. We've grown a highly-regarded healthcare practice group. We've expanded into Canada. But even more important, we've established a rock-solid reputation for exceptional and innovative work within the life sciences industry.</p>
                  <p>That dedication carries over outside of the office, too, where Steve oversees the events and fundraising efforts of a highly regarded nonprofit group, <a href="http://allintofightcancer.org" target="_blank">All-In To Fight Cancer</a>. No doubt, though, the best thing we can say about Steve is that he's a loving husband and the proud father of four. </p>

                <p>Angelic uses the word "client" a lot. She talks about the <em>client</em> experience. She believes in building <em>client</em> trust, confidence and respect. She emphasizes the importance of establishing personal relationships with <em>clients</em>.</p>
                <p>In fact, her client focus is so intense, that if you sat in on a business meeting but didn't catch her title, you might never guess that Angelic's actual area of expertise is "technology."</p>
                <p>As the head of Technekes' technology group, Angelic has plenty of IT experience and credentials, but plainly, what makes her unique is how she approaches technology from a very "human" perspective, constantly collaborating to come up with solutions that help real people achieve real goals. Clients appreciate her</p>
                <p>persistence, her spunk, and her all-out determination to make all communications &mdash; whether digital, written, or face-to-face &mdash; an exceptional experience.</p>

                  <hr>
                  <p>At the intersection of Poise, Dedication, Service and Professionalism, you'll find Diana. She's our resident ag marketing expert, but not because she grew up on a farm.  And not because she snagged any kind of ag degree. In fact, when she first arrived at Technekes, she wasn't a seasoned marketer. She was a hungry grad with a freshly minted marketing degree and an abundance of moxie. Therein lies the key to her success. Every day, for the past seven seasons, Diana has demonstrated an infectious energy and enthusiasm for our industry, for her clients and, most importantly, for driving sales.</p>
                  <p> Diana's walked fields, ridden with reps, and called on ag dealers across North America.  She's tirelessly conceived and delivered hundreds of marketing campaigns with an attention to detail that's earned the admiration and respect of clients and co-workers alike.</p>
                  <p>As a result, Diana's the youngest ever at Technekes to earn the title of VP, a seat on our Leadership Team, and our company's highest award, "Top Gear."</p>
                  <p>Most days, she's hard at work before sun up, because she cares so deeply about doing great work and squeezing in extra time with her adorable family. And here's something else you might not know about Diana &mdash; she has a terrific singing voice &mdash; and recently completed her first 10k!</p>

                  <p style="overflow: auto;"><i>"If there's something Jack can't do with data, I'll be damned if I know what it is. He's the best I've ever seen. No one else even comes close."</i> -Preston Fay</p>
                  <p>Jack's a technical tour de force. As Technekes' visionary, Jack is well and truly a "Jack of all trades." He's deeply experienced in virtually every aspect of technology and its application to drive marketing and sales. He builds marketing  databases and data warehouses, and he helps the team at Technekes interpret and present data in ground-breaking ways to add value to everything we do.  And the best part is that Jack's every bit as competent a marketer as a techie. He gets it.</p>
                  <p>Quality, accuracy and relevance are cornerstones of Jack's approach to using data to make client sales happen - and measuring success at every point along the way.</p>

                  <p>His methods have served him well over the past 25 years where he leveraged his Ivy League degree in computer science to start his career as advertising agency designer (go figure) to pioneer database development capabilities across the agricultural industry in the US and Europe.</p>
                  <p>Here at work, you'll find Jack with his constant canine companions, Roxxy and Lucy.  At home, you'll find him with his lovely bride and adorable toddler daughter. And in what little remains of his spare time, you'll find him either banging away on one of his many Macs or banging away at clay pigeons. Jack's a nationally ranked shooter &mdash; as precise in the field as he is <nobr>with data.</nobr></p>

                  <hr>
                <p><i>Passionate, innovative and creative </i>best describe Preston. He's a data-driven marketing craftsman with a vision for designing multi-channel marketing and sales programs that work. He pushes himself and Technekes to pursue ever-higher levels of competency.</p>
                <p>"It's exceptionally gratifying when all the moving parts come together - strategy, creative, technology, marketing and sales. We make them sing as one, and when that happens, our clients always make a lot of money. That's the most satisfying thing I could ever do."</p>
                <p>Preston's plied his trade as a marketer with a who's who list of clients for nearly 25 years,</p>
                <p>having worked his way up from agency copywriter to account guy to managing director of a European database marketing company to co-founder of Technekes.</p>
                <p>Preston's our resident practical joker, rarely passing on an opportunity to capitalize on something funny. Outside Technekes, he’s often playing soccer or in a far-away river coaxing a trout to his fly.</p>

                    <p style="overflow: auto;">Although still fairly new to Technekes, in the words of founder Preston Fay, <i>"Joan pretty much defines the Technekes mindset and philosophy."</i></p>
                    <p>In other words, Joan flat-out knows how to dig in and get things done, with a healthy serving of professionalism and humor.</p>
                    <p>A born marketer who's well-familiar with the unique cycles of the Canadian agriculture, Joan has blazed a trail for women in the business, starting with her very first jobs in inside sales and pesticide safety instruction, to opening her own well-known and highly-regarded ag communication business, to her role as manager of a large ag database company. </p>
                    <p>And along the way, she's earned a reputation for delivering the best possible marketing solution for each and every client. And now, she brings all that to bear here at Technekes.

                  <p>A gifted marketer, Ashley leads Technekes' Ag Practice by example. She tirelessly supports her clients and her team, bringing 20+ years of agricultural marketing experience to bear with exceptional effect.</p>
                  <p>Ashley's stood in her clients' shoes, having walked fields and sold "belly-to-belly" with growers as a district manager for a major seed company.</p>
                  <p>She built and led the database marketing capability for one of her industry's largest crop protection manufacturers. A captivating presenter, she's as comfortable in the boardroom as in the field.</p>
                  <p>You'll likely never meet a more knowledgeable professional who always remembers "the little things" that make a difference with customers and colleagues - a note on your birthday, a hand-written thank you, or a note for a job well   done. Ashley is, in a word, inspirational.</p>
                  <p>When not hard at work with clients or developing her team, Ashley inspires her family and her two Pomeranians, Duchess<br>and Lady.</p>
