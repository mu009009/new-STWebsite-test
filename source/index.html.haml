          Stratifyd was founded in 2012 with two key objectives: create a data
          analytics platform anyone can use; and make it powerful enough everyone
          will want to use. Our founder, Derek Wang, Ph.D., brought an academic approach
          to an existing challenge and assembled a team to develop a powerful yet simple
          method of identifying and visualizing both structured and unstructured data.
          By abandoning traditional models and processes and allowing augmented human
          intelligence through our patented machine learning, Stratifyd has enabled our
          customers to turn their unstructured and unused data into revenue opportunities.

          %p
            Data proliferation coupled with the pace of business innovation
            is accelerating and the ability to perform targeted analysis before
            windows of opportunity close is paramount.  The fundamental challenge
            of traditional analytics is that it requires you to know what you’re
            looking for from the start.  As products, feedback and interaction
            methods evolve - you must constantly maintain those changes in
            traditional taxonomies and ontological maps.  It takes time, money
            and specialized skills to stay current, unfortunately most analytical
            campaigns run beyond the window of opportunity.

          %p
            Based on years of academic research and innovation in the
            field of data science, our platform uses next generation technology
            to “learn” the contents of any data set without the need for
            predetermined structures or methods of interpretation.  The unbiased,
            immediate and highly intuitive results allow users to transition from
            raw data to decision BEFORE it’s too late.
