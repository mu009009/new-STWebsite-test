  title: 'Discover Actionable Insights from Unstructured Data'
  description: 'We’ve all heard about the quantity of unstructured data – over 80% of business-relevant information exists in an unstructured format (primarily text). Many companies are looking for tools to derive actionable insights and value from this rapidly growing volume of data, but perceived complexities (cost, expertise, learning curve, time) dissuade them from doing so. However, the advent of visual text analytics platforms has changed the paradigm and made gleaning insight from text easier than ever. Visual text analytics platforms empower everybody to augment decision making processes from data driven foundations and should be an essential component of any comprehensive business intelligence program.'
