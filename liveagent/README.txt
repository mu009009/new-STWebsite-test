The files are set up in a way that separates the files that can be used across all of the sites vs the ones specific to a particular site.

Files in the "global" directory are the generic images, css and javascript that would be common across the sites.

The "sanctura/skin" directory has the css and images that create the look and layout of the Sanctura site.
The "sanctura/images" directory is for non-layout images like photos or custom banners used within the page.
